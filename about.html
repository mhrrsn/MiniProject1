        <h2>About Me</h2>
        </br>
        <h5><em>Who am I?</em></h5>
            <p>I'm Mia - Just a mid-twenties girlie trying to find her way in life!</p>
        <h5><em>What is my professional / academic background?</em></h5>
            <p>I graduated from NUS in 2020 at the very start of the pandemic, with a Bachelor's in Global Studies (a multidisciplinary program that spanned across Political Sciece, History, Geography, Sociology etc.)</p>
            <p>Out of graduation, I worked as a Research Executive at NTUC First Campus, an early childhood organisation.</p>
            <p>I then moved to my current role, Business Manager, at an Education Technology company.</p>
        <h5>How did I become an F1 girlie?</h5>
            <p>One of the verticals that my company focuses on is Research, and racing was one of the key segments we foucsed on. Our ML capabilities analysed various aspects of racing from car sensors to damage image recognition, and we even covered the commercial aspect of racing such as Brand Recognition.</p>
            <p>We're working with some of the F1 teams which pushed me to learn more about this part of motorsports.</p>
            <p>It helped that Netflix had the F1 documentary, Drive to Survive, which made it very easy to jump on the F1 bandwagon.</p>
            <p>And here I am!</p>
